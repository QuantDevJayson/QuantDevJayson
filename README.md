I solve process and systems optimization, growth, and risk challenges for businesses across global markets by combining finance expertise with deep tech skills in Rust, Python, Django, Next.js, blockchain, and AI. With focus in quant finance, DeFi, and full-stack engineering, I’ve built credit risk models, trading systems, value-chain ecosystems, and tokenized finance platforms that unlock capital access, boost efficiency, and deliver measurable growth. From complexity to clarity, I turn finance and tech into growth you can measure. 

🌍 Mission
